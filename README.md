# MEC-325-Wheelchair-Design- 

The primary objective of this project was to create an intervention that allows those who require mobility aid to be able to expolre and adventure terrains that the user would not normally be able to encounter if using a regular wheelchair. The design of the All-Terrain Mobility Aid incorporates human design factors to make the using the product that much easier to use. Along with a critical and analytical design, team/project maneghment skills were showcased to help succesfully meet deadlines and complete given tasks. The collabrative group effort helped mimic a proffesional work environment where indivisuals were held accountable for thier work.
